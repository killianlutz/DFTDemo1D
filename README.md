## Signal analysis and compression
- Record your own voice or make-up a sampled signal of your choice. 
- Understand the sampled signal in the Fourier domain, or compress and denoise it by thresholding the Fourier components which contribute the least.
- Listen and compare the sampled signal and its compressed version.

## Source code
The code in the `src/` folder is written in `Julia` and builds upon the plotting library [GLMakie](https://docs.makie.org/stable/).

## Getting started 
Create a directory, open the terminal and run
```
git clone https://github.com/killianlutz/DFTDemo1D.git
```
Then open and run the file `scripts/run_animation.jl` in your favorite code editor. 
Check out the associated notebook for further details `notebooks/introduction.ipynb`. Enjoy!

## Last words
The source code is mainly provided for reproducibility purposes and the user's convenience. Any suggestions are more than welcome.

If you enjoy those animations, I would be grateful if you could refer to this [repository](https://github.com/killianlutz/DFTDemo1D) or its author [Killian Lutz](https://github.com/killianlutz).

Thank you for your time and enjoy!
